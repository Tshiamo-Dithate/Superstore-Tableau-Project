# Superstore-Tableau-Project
Objective

The objective of this project is to create a Tableau dashboard to compare sales between two regions using the Sample Superstore dataset. The dashboard will allow upper management to visualize the following metrics and make data-driven decisions:

- First Order Date
- Total Sales
- Average Sales per Order
- Number of Customers
- Number of Orders
- Number of Products Sold

Dataset

- Source: Sample Superstore Dataset
- The dataset contains sales records, customer information, order details, and product data.

Steps to Perform
1. Data Selection and Organization

    Use the Sample Superstore dataset.
    Select the relevant data for analysis by grouping data fields such as Customer Name and Order ID.
    Create a folder in the Data Source table to segregate and organize the data thoroughly.

2. Hierarchy Creation

    Create a hierarchy called Location using the Country field to structure the geographical data.

3. Parameter Setup

    Create two parameters: Primary Region and Secondary Region.
        These parameters should list all available regions.
        The selected regions will be used to compare sales performance.

4. Calculated Fields

    Create calculated fields for both the Primary Region and Secondary Region based on the selected parameters.
    Create a calculated field for the First Order Date.

5. Dashboard Creation

    Design the dashboard by aligning all the relevant sheets.
    Partition the dashboard to display the details of both the Primary Region and Secondary Region. Ensure that the following metrics are included for both regions:
   - First Order Date
   - Total Sales
   - Average Sales per Order
   - Number of Customers
   - Number of Orders
   - Number of Products in Sale

Deliverables

    A fully interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes the sales comparison between two selected regions.
    Key metrics to inform upper management about the sales performance and provide insights for improvements.

Conclusion

By using this dashboard, upper management will have a clear comparison of sales performance between the selected regions. This will help them understand the key metrics and drive decision-making for improvements in sales strategies.
